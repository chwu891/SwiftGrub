# Social Dining and Restaurant Check-In App

This is a social dining app that lets users check in or out of restaurants, see who is currently at various locations, and easily get directions to any restaurant. Users can customize their profiles with personal details and share their dining status with others. Each restaurant has its own profile, featuring images, descriptions, contact information, and options to call, visit the website, or get directions, making it easy to connect and coordinate with friends during dining experiences.

## Description

This project was developed based on [Sean Allen's iOS development course "Dub Dub Grub"](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/dub-dub-grub-swiftui-mapkit-cloudkit). This project demonstrates modern iOS development practices using SwiftUI, CloudKit, and other advanced features. It focuses on providing a seamless user experience with real-time restaurant check-ins, detailed location data, and interactive map functionalities.

The project has been updated to be compatible with the latest development tools and operating systems:
- **Xcode 15.4**
- **iOS 17.5**
- **iPadOS 17.5**

## Learning Objectives

- **MVVM Architecture**: Understand and implement the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern to improve code organization and testability.
- **SwiftUI**: Develop a fully functional and responsive user interface using SwiftUI.
- **MapKit**: Utilize MapKit for custom map annotations, directions, and other map-related functionalities.
- **CloudKit**: Learn how to use CloudKit for managing and storing user data and restaurant information in the cloud.
- **Async/Await**: Master asynchronous programming with async and await for clearer and more efficient code.
- **Multi-threading**: Learn how to perform background tasks to keep the app responsive.
- **Accessibility**: Implement accessibility features to ensure the app is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Enhance user interactions with haptic feedback to provide a more engaging experience.
- **Safe Coding Practices**: Apply safe coding practices to create a robust and crash-resistant application.
